To display the data I've used [Charts.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to draw the chart and [Bootstrap Table](https://bootstrap-table.com/) to display a sortable, searchable, and clickable data table.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\nThe dashboard is still raw, but it provides the basic functionality of displaying the global and per-country data charts.\n\nFor example here is how Global dynamics of confirmed/recovered/deaths use-cases looks like as for March 23rd:\n\n![Global data](assets/0.png)\n\nHere we may see positive dynamics for China (Hubei):\n\n![China - Hubei statistics](assets/1.png)\n\nWe may also compare Italy to Spain:\n\n![Italy and Spain statistics](assets/2.png)\n\nThe regions are displayed in sortable, searchable, and clickable data-table:\n\n![Data table](assets/3.png)\n\n### Known issues\n\nThe following functionality is not implemented yet but it would improve the usability of the dashboard:\n\n- Grouping the regions by countries to see aggregated statistics for the whole US, China, etc. (for now statistics for the US is split by states)\n- Resetting the regions/countries selection by one click\n- Putting the selected filters to the URL so that the dashboard link would be sharable (with pre-selected filters)\n","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020/coronavirus-covid-19-dashboard/"},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/trekhleb.github.io/trekhleb.github.io/src/posts/2020/coronavirus-covid-19-dashboard/index.md"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Iâ€™ve open-sourced a simple Coronavirus (COVID-19) dashboard","summary":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) dashboard to show the dynamics of Ð¡oronavirus distribution per country","date":"23 March, 2020","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.9230769230769231,"src":"/static/0b1e786ce0ff8243fab1a7616c803aee/eb0de/01-cover.png","srcSet":"/static/0b1e786ce0ff8243fab1a7616c803aee/bd3a8/01-cover.png 250w,\n/static/0b1e786ce0ff8243fab1a7616c803aee/0757b/01-cover.png 500w,\n/static/0b1e786ce0ff8243fab1a7616c803aee/eb0de/01-cover.png 1000w,\n/static/0b1e786ce0ff8243fab1a7616c803aee/8f0de/01-cover.png 1208w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2020/coronavirus-covid-19-dashboard/","frontmatter":{"title":"Iâ€™ve open-sourced a simple Coronavirus (COVID-19) dashboard","summary":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) dashboard to show the dynamics of Ð¡oronavirus distribution per country","cover":"assets/01-cover.png","date":"2020-03-23T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
