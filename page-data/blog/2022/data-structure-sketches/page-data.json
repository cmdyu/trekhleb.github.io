I wanted it to be a place where people could do fast, ad-hoc, napkin-based-like explanations of any concept as if you are sitting with your friend and trying to explain him/her something during lunch. Don't ask me why it is needed, I was just experimenting.\n\n> Btw, that's why the app name is \"Ok! So...\", because oftentimes these are the opening words after you pick up the pen and the piece of paper (or a whiteboard) and start drawing. I didn't see the study and the statistics of the opening phrases though, so I might be wrong here, here üòÄ\n\nSo, the first concept I've tried to explain with sketches was the Data Structures. Without further ado, here is the interactive ‚úçüèª [Data Structure Sketches](https://okso.app/showcase/data-structures) showcase that you may play with.\n\n![Data Structure Sketches](https://trekhleb.dev/okso-app/assets/demo/demo-12-showcase-data-structures-sm-x2.gif)\n\n> Here is a [YouTube version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaOWTOWOWGk) of the GIF just in case.\n\nOf course, not all data structures are covered. And of course, this is not comprehensive material, but rather a cheatsheet that would create visual hints and associations for the following data structures:\n\n- Linked List\n- Doubly Linked List\n- Queue\n- Stack\n- Hash Table (with hash collision resolution)\n- Tree (including the Binary Search Tree)\n- Heap (including Mean Heap and Max Heap)\n- Trie\n- Graph\n\nEach box on the sketch is clickable, so you may dig into the data structure you're interested. For example `Heap ‚Üí Max Heap`, or `Heap ‚Üí Min Heap`, or `Heap ‚Üí Array Representation`.\n\nThe sketches are split into so-called Pages just to make it easier to grasp them, so the users stay focused on one concept at a time, they see the relationship between the concept, and thus, hopefully, they are not getting overwhelmed with seeing a lot of information at the same time on one drawing/page.\n\nEach page has a link to the source-code examples that are implementing the data structure on JavaScript.\n\nHere are some examples of the sketches.\n\n**Doubly Linked List**\n\n![Doubly Linked List](https://trekhleb.dev/okso-app/assets/demo/demo-12-showcase-data-structures-02.png)\n\n**Tree**\n\n![Doubly Linked List](https://trekhleb.dev/okso-app/assets/demo/demo-12-showcase-data-structures-03.png)\n\n**Hash Table**\n\n![Doubly Linked List](https://trekhleb.dev/okso-app/assets/demo/demo-12-showcase-data-structures-05.png)\n\n**Trie**\n\n![Doubly Linked List](https://trekhleb.dev/okso-app/assets/demo/demo-12-showcase-data-structures-04.png)\n\n**Graph**\n\n![Doubly Linked List](https://trekhleb.dev/okso-app/assets/demo/demo-12-showcase-data-structures-06.png)\n\nThe full list you may find in the ‚úçüèª [Data Structure Sketches](https://okso.app/showcase/data-structures) showcase.\n\nI hope you find this showcase useful and I hope it will be a good visual cheatsheet-like complement to your data structure knowledge.\n","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2022/data-structure-sketches/"},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/trekhleb.github.io/trekhleb.github.io/src/posts/2022/data-structure-sketches/index.mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Data Structure Sketches","summary":"Basic data structures explained with minimalistic sketches","date":"31 August, 2022","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.1367521367521367,"src":"/static/38ffac265b733d493674704f86a733fa/9aebb/01-cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/38ffac265b733d493674704f86a733fa/d2e8d/01-cover.jpg 250w,\n/static/38ffac265b733d493674704f86a733fa/55b1d/01-cover.jpg 500w,\n/static/38ffac265b733d493674704f86a733fa/9aebb/01-cover.jpg 1000w,\n/static/38ffac265b733d493674704f86a733fa/e4ddd/01-cover.jpg 1500w,\n/static/38ffac265b733d493674704f86a733fa/6dae3/01-cover.jpg 2000w,\n/static/38ffac265b733d493674704f86a733fa/499bc/01-cover.jpg 2094w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2022/data-structure-sketches/","frontmatter":{"title":"Data Structure Sketches","summary":"Basic data structures explained with minimalistic sketches","cover":"assets/01-cover.jpeg","date":"2022-08-31T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
