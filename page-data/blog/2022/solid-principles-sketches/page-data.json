And, as a continuation of my previous [S.O.L.I.D. Principles Around You](https://trekhleb.dev/blog/2017/solid-principles-around-you/) article, I've organized it in [interactive sketches](https://okso.app/showcase/solid) that you may find [here](https://okso.app/showcase/solid).\n\nCheck what I've got:\n\n![](assets/demo-14-showcase-solid.gif)\n\nSo, each SOLID principle has a dedicated sketch page that look like the following\n\n![](assets/demo-14-showcase-solid-01.png)\n\n## Single Responsibility Principle\n\n[SRP Sketch](https://okso.app/showcase/solid/page/924000bf-21ec-4580-36f4-49ee920abe55)\n\nA class should have only a single responsibility. Only one potential change in the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.\n\n![](assets/demo-14-showcase-solid-02.png)\n\n## Open/Closed Principle\n\n[OCP Sketch](https://okso.app/showcase/solid/page/f297d650-5343-4423-39b9-6a1dbb21e5df)\n\nSoftware entities should be open for EXTENSION, but closed for MODIFICATION. Allow behavior to be extended without modifying the source code.\n\n![](assets/demo-14-showcase-solid-03.png)\n\n## Liskov Substitution Principle\n\n[LSP Sketch](https://okso.app/showcase/solid/page/2899b427-2bd8-4899-16a7-0ce855331ba2)\n\nObjects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.\n\n![](assets/demo-14-showcase-solid-04.png)\n\n## Interface Segregation Principle\n\n[ISP Sketch](https://okso.app/showcase/solid/page/5464baff-5793-482a-0dfa-bab4337fe3ed)\n\nMany client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.\n\n![](assets/demo-14-showcase-solid-05.png)\n\n## Dependency Inversion Principle\n\n[DIP Sketch](https://okso.app/showcase/solid/page/70a27e39-47db-4ada-2065-f023372e1933)\n\nOne should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.\n\n- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\n- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.\n\n![](assets/demo-14-showcase-solid-06.png)\n\n> In the future I plan to add more visual explainers like this one to the [okso.app showcase](https://okso.app/showcase). Currently there is a [Data Structures](https://okso.app/showcase/data-structures) sketch is available that is done in a similar style as SOLID one. I hope having such visual explainers in one place will be convenient for you.\n","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2022/solid-principles-sketches/"},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/trekhleb.github.io/trekhleb.github.io/src/posts/2022/solid-principles-sketches/index.mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"SOLID Principles Sketches","summary":"SOLID programming principles explained with minimalistic sketches and real-world examples","date":"06 October, 2022","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/921956fa2b6f56d35a9417b588c73901/a92da/02-cover.png","srcSet":"/static/921956fa2b6f56d35a9417b588c73901/ad38c/02-cover.png 750w,\n/static/921956fa2b6f56d35a9417b588c73901/a92da/02-cover.png 1024w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/921956fa2b6f56d35a9417b588c73901/04479/02-cover.webp 750w,\n/static/921956fa2b6f56d35a9417b588c73901/6bd68/02-cover.webp 1024w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.625}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2022/solid-principles-sketches/","frontmatter":{"title":"SOLID Principles Sketches","summary":"SOLID programming principles explained with minimalistic sketches and real-world examples","cover":"assets/02-cover.png","date":"2022-10-06T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
