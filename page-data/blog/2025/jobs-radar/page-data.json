To explore this, I created a draft (prototype) of **Tech Jobs Radar**: [jobs-radar.com](https://jobs-radar.com)\n\n![Tech Jobs Radar](./assets/demo-01.gif)\n\nThe dashboard visualizes a snapshot of open top tech positions on a map (currently based on December 2024 data). To make comparisons easier, it aggregates jobs into clusters depending on the zoom level, allowing you to analyze data across continents, countries, states, or counties.\n\nThe data for December 2024 contains a snapshot of `32054` open job positions from the top `53` tech companies across `58` countries.\n\n> The \"Top Tech\" here refers to a subset of the largest tech companies by market capitalization or smaller companies known for their technically challenging products. Please note that the company list is not exhaustive, and the job listings may be incomplete. The website is not intended for active job seeking but rather aims to provide a global perspective on the distribution of high-tech job opportunities.\n\n> The data may contain location errors. Also not all jobs may be technical. So, treat the numbers more like a general trend than a precise statistics.\n\n![Tech Jobs Radar](./assets/demo-01.png)\n\n![Tech Jobs Radar](./assets/demo-02.png)\n\nIt also includes company and country filters to help you explore specific slices of the data - for instance, you can check open positions at Uber or identify the main engineering hubs for a particular company.\n\nAdditionally, you can search for jobs by title. Each listing includes a link to the detailed description on Indeed.\n\n![Tech Jobs Radar](./assets/demo-03.png)\n\nHere are some numbers...\n\n### Jobs distribution by continents\n\nAmong `32054` open job positions (in Dec 2024):\n- North America â€” `16166` (50%)\n- Asia â€” `8334` (26%)\n- Europe â€” `6321` (20%)\n- Oceania â€” `623` (1.9%)\n- South America â€” `553` (1.7%)\n- Africa  â€” `57` (0.1%)\n\n### European tech hubs\n\nThose `53` tech companies that I've collected (the collection is far from being exhaustive though) are mostly presented in:\n- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany\n- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ United Kingdom\n- ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª Ireland\n- ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Netherlands\n- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· France\n\n![Stat](./assets/stat-01.png)\n\n### FAANG hubs\n\nHere are the Top 10 countries by the number of open job positions at FAANG:\n\n1. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ United States â€” `4208` (48%)\n2. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ China â€” `795` (9%)\n3. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ India â€” `704` (8%)\n4. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ United Kingdom â€” `324` (4%)\n5. ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany â€” `295` (3%)\n6. ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ Singapore â€” `290` (3%)\n7. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª Ireland â€” `268` (3%)\n8. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Canada â€” `229` (3%)\n9. ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Australia â€” `170` (2%)\n10. ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ Taiwan â€” `166` (2%)\n\n![Stat](./assets/stat-02.png)\n\n### Open jobs per capita\n\nI was curious to see the ratio between the number of open tech job positions and the population of each country. Here are the Top 10 countries with the highest amount of jobs per capita:\n\n1. ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ Singapore â€” `18` Ã—10<sup>-5</sup>\n2. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª Ireland â€” `12` Ã—10<sup>-5</sup>\n3. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡± Israel â€” `5.9` Ã—10<sup>-5</sup>\n4. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ United States â€” `4.3` Ã—10<sup>-5</sup>\n5. ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Netherlands â€” `3.2` Ã—10<sup>-5</sup>\n6. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡· Costa Rica â€” `2.3` Ã—10<sup>-5</sup>\n7. ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡º Luxembourg â€” `2.3` Ã—10<sup>-5</sup>\n8. ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany â€” `2.2` Ã—10<sup>-5</sup>\n9. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ Czech Republic â€” `2.2` Ã—10<sup>-5</sup>\n10. ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Australia â€” `2.2` Ã—10<sup>-5</sup>\n\n![Stat](./assets/stat-03.png)\n","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2025/jobs-radar/"},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/trekhleb.github.io/trekhleb.github.io/src/posts/2025/jobs-radar/index.mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tech Jobs Radar","summary":"A snapshot of open job positions from the top tech companies around the world, offering insights into geographical trends in the tech job market.","date":"12 January, 2025","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/a72a6/02-cover.png","srcSet":"/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/0bcd5/02-cover.png 750w,\n/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/8cc56/02-cover.png 1080w,\n/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/35541/02-cover.png 1366w,\n/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/a72a6/02-cover.png 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/2afb7/02-cover.webp 750w,\n/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/5b69e/02-cover.webp 1080w,\n/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/9a2b7/02-cover.webp 1366w,\n/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/2c5d7/02-cover.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.4979166666666667}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2025/jobs-radar/","frontmatter":{"title":"Tech Jobs Radar","summary":"A snapshot of open job positions from the top tech companies around the world, offering insights into geographical trends in the tech job market.","cover":"assets/02-cover.png","date":"2025-01-12T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
