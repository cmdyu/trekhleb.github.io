To explore this, I created a draft (prototype) of **Tech Jobs Radar**: [jobs-radar.com](https://jobs-radar.com)\n\n![Tech Jobs Radar](./assets/demo-01.gif)\n\nThe dashboard visualizes a snapshot of open top tech positions on a map (currently based on December 2024 data). To make comparisons easier, it aggregates jobs into clusters depending on the zoom level, allowing you to analyze data across continents, countries, states, or counties.\n\nThe data for December 2024 contains a snapshot of `32054` open job positions from the top `53` tech companies across `58` countries.\n\n> The \"Top Tech\" here refers to a subset of the largest tech companies by market capitalization or smaller companies known for their technically challenging products. Please note that the company list is not exhaustive, and the job listings may be incomplete. The website is not intended for active job seeking but rather aims to provide a global perspective on the distribution of high-tech job opportunities.\n\n![Tech Jobs Radar](./assets/demo-01.png)\n\n![Tech Jobs Radar](./assets/demo-02.png)\n\nIt also includes company and country filters to help you explore specific slices of the data - for instance, you can check open positions at Uber or identify the main engineering hubs for a particular company.\n\nAdditionally, you can search for jobs by title. Each listing includes a link to the detailed description on Indeed.\n\n![Tech Jobs Radar](./assets/demo-03.png)\n\nI'm sharing it here in case others are also curious about analyzing this kind of data.\n","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2025/jobs-radar/"},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/trekhleb.github.io/trekhleb.github.io/src/posts/2025/jobs-radar/index.mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tech Jobs Radar","summary":"A snapshot of open job positions from the top tech companies around the world, offering insights into geographical trends in the tech job market.","date":"12 January, 2025","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/a72a6/02-cover.png","srcSet":"/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/0bcd5/02-cover.png 750w,\n/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/8cc56/02-cover.png 1080w,\n/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/35541/02-cover.png 1366w,\n/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/a72a6/02-cover.png 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/2afb7/02-cover.webp 750w,\n/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/5b69e/02-cover.webp 1080w,\n/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/9a2b7/02-cover.webp 1366w,\n/static/b261374b972ce19aca37576a7aa93815/2c5d7/02-cover.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.4979166666666667}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2025/jobs-radar/","frontmatter":{"title":"Tech Jobs Radar","summary":"A snapshot of open job positions from the top tech companies around the world, offering insights into geographical trends in the tech job market.","cover":"assets/02-cover.png","date":"2025-01-12T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
