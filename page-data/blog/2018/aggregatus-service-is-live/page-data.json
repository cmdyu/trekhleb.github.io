All this information from many data-sources may be scraped and aggregated by Aggregatus into collections.\n\nAggregatus users are able to create many collections (collection of shoes, collection of blog posts etc.). Each collection contains data of certain type with specific set of data properties. For example shoes collection might have data with such data properties as name, photo, category, available sizes and so on.\n\nYou may check several examples of how those collections may look like by visiting [Nike Shoes](https://aggregatus.io/collection/1) or [Startup News](https://aggregatus.io/collection/2) collections.\n\n![aggregatus shoes](assets/03-shoes.png)\n\n## See how it works in action\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_3hk3dTqR4\" frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n\nOne of the challenging tasks for the Aggregatus users was a necessity to come up with a proper CSS selector on the 3rd-party web-sites for the elements that users want to parse/scrape the data from.\n\nTo make it easier the *CSS Wizard* feature was developed. It allows the users to preview the 3rd-party web-site inside the Aggregatus pop-up window, click on the elements that need to be parsed, and immediately get the CSS selector that might be used to scrape the data from the clicked element.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8V3shqtDsrQ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n\n> The project is still in alpha stage of testing. This means that its features may be unstable. But also it means that a lot of new features are on their way. You also may take part in testing the project and [reporting new bugs and ideas](https://aggregatus.io/contact).\n\n> **UPD 2019:** The service was deprecated...\n","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018/aggregatus-service-is-live/"},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/trekhleb.github.io/trekhleb.github.io/src/posts/2018/aggregatus-service-is-live/index.md"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Aggregatus — new data aggregation service — is now live and in alpha","summary":"Aggregate data from many sources into one collection","date":"07 March, 2018","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAMCAYAAABiDJ37AAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAA9UlEQVR42q2TTQ6CMBSETXAhKGhLW1f+LDSCR1AOI9Er6CXEhFvoBd0yZkgwKA0x6uKlvAa+zswrHSFlESoFpTWElN9WwXUkxL0TKlXIMIQ25j9ApXVBdYRS6UiI34CVZYIIfrfuBwG8fh8D3y8P/RhIy1zfazKdYhVFWCyXcBwHwXBoA79mSFX8mC+y2JvxuNzbpSmyywXnLMP+cMBsPrdBm8A6lGpZfD6eTrjebmXleY54vbbZb1quA+t9FMdIkgSb7RZOt1tm2mqZTTUI21Copue6cD3veWDrULQxzwxt16bKtWXCzQwri1/ewablH/+SF+ADxTgt/6d09+0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=","aspectRatio":1.6025641025641026,"src":"/static/26d12517f074bef42315f12219a81b42/eb0de/01-cover.png","srcSet":"/static/26d12517f074bef42315f12219a81b42/bd3a8/01-cover.png 250w,\n/static/26d12517f074bef42315f12219a81b42/0757b/01-cover.png 500w,\n/static/26d12517f074bef42315f12219a81b42/eb0de/01-cover.png 1000w,\n/static/26d12517f074bef42315f12219a81b42/3c6b4/01-cover.png 1500w,\n/static/26d12517f074bef42315f12219a81b42/950cd/01-cover.png 2000w,\n/static/26d12517f074bef42315f12219a81b42/be98d/01-cover.png 2100w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018/aggregatus-service-is-live/","frontmatter":{"title":"Aggregatus — new data aggregation service — is now live and in alpha","summary":"Aggregate data from many sources into one collection","cover":"assets/01-cover.png","date":"2018-03-07T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
